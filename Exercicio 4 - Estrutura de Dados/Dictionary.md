Dictionaries are used to store data values in `key: value` pairs. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be __immutable__. Dictionaries has a fast lookup, insert and delete elements.
```python
dictonary = {"age": 12, "name": 32, "email": "example@mail.com"}
```
