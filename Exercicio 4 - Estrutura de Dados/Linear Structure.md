A linear [[Data Structure]] is a type of data structure that stores the data linearly or sequentially. In the linear data structure, data is arranged in such a way that one element is adjacent to its previous and the next element. It includes the data at a single level such that we can traverse all data into a single run. The most common linear structures are:
- [[Array]]
- [[Linked List]]
- [[Queue]]
- [[Stack]]

|                   | Array                                                                        | Singly Linked List                                                               | Doubly Linked List                                                     | Queue                                                           | Stack                                                         |

| Basics            | Store multiple elements in a single variable, organized in a specific order  | Stores the data in `nodes` with a reference to the next node                     | Stores data in `nodes` with references to both next and previous nodes | The objects are removed and inserted from two different ends    | The objects are removed or inserted at the same end.          |
| Working Principle | Uses index-based access, fixed size or dynamically allocated                 | Sequential access, dynamic size                                                  | Sequential access, dynamic size                                        | **FIFO (First In, First Out)** first added is the first removed | **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** last added is the first removed |
| Operations        | Index-based access, insert, delete, update                                   | Insert, delete, traversal                                                        | Insert, delete (both forward and backward), traversal                  | Uses `enqueue` (insert) and `dequeue` (remove)                  | Uses `push` (insert) and `pop` (remove)                       |
| When              | When you need fast access to elements via index and know the size in advance | When you frequently insert/delete at the head, and donâ€™t need backward traversal | When frequent insertions/deletions are needed in both directions       | When processing tasks in order                                  | When backtracking is required                                 |
| Why               | Efficient for random access and memory locality                              | Memory efficient for frequent insert/delete; no need to shift elements           | Enables two-way traversal and easier deletion of known nodes           | Ensures order of processing; avoids starvation                  | Simplifies tracking of nested or recursive processes          |
